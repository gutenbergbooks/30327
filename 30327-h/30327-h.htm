<h3><a name = "intro" id = "intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h3>


<p>Henry More (1614-1687), the most interesting member of that group
traditionally known as the Cambridge Platonists, lived conscientiously
and well. Having early set out on one course, he never thought to change
it; he devoted his whole life to the joy of celebrating, again and
again, “a&nbsp;firm and unshaken Belief of the Existence of GOD
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;, a God infinitely Good, as well as infinitely
Great&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id =
"tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> Such faith was for More the starting point
of his rational understanding: “with the most fervent Prayers” he
beseeched God, in his autobiographical “Praefatio Generalissima,” “to
set me free from the dark Chains, and this so sordid Captivity of my own
Will.” More offered to faith all which his reason could know, and so it
happened that he “was got into a most Joyous and Lucid State of Mind,”
something quite ineffable; to preserve these “Sensations and Experiences
of my own Soul,” he wrote “a&nbsp;pretty full Poem call’d
<i>Psychozoia</i>” (or <i>A&nbsp;Christiano-Platonicall display of
Life</i>), an exercise begun about 1640 and designed for no audience but
himself. There were times, More continued in his autobiographical
remarks, when he thought of destroying <i>Psychozoia</i> because its
style is rough and its language filled with archaisms. His principal
purpose in that poem was to demonstrate in detail the spiritual
foundation of all existence; Psyche, his heroine, is the daughter of the
Absolute, the general Soul who holds together the metaphysical universe,
against whom he sees reflected his own soul’s mystical progress. More
must, nevertheless, have been pleased with his labor, for he next wrote
<i>Psychathanasia Platonica: or Platonicall Poem of the Immortality of
Souls, especially Mans Soul</i>, in which he attempts to demonstrate the
immortality of the soul as a corrective to his age. Then, he joined to
that <i>Antipsychopannychia, or A&nbsp;Confutation of the sleep of the
Soul
<span class = "pagenum">ii</span>
<!-- png 04 -->
after death</i>, and <i>Antimonopsychia, or That all Souls are not
one</i>; at the urging of friends, he published the poems in
1642&mdash;his first literary work&mdash;as <i>Psychodia
Platonica</i>.</p>

<p>In his argument for the soul’s immortality toward the end of
<i>Psychathanasia</i> (III.4), More had urged that there was no need to
plead for any extension of the infinite (“a&nbsp;contradiction,” and
also, it would seem, a&nbsp;fruitless inquiry); but he soon changed his
mind. The preface to <i>Democritus Platonissans</i> reproduces those
stanzas of the earlier poem which deny infinity (34&nbsp;to the end of
the canto) with a new (formerly concluding) stanza 39 and three further
stanzas “for a more easie and naturall leading to the present Canto,”
<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Democritus Platonissans</i>, which More clearly intended
to be an addition, a&nbsp;fifth canto to <i>Psychathanasia</i> (Book
III); and although <i>Democritus Platonissans</i> first appeared
separately, More appended it to <i>Psychathanasia</i> in the second
edition of his collected poems, this time with English titles, the whole
being called <i>A&nbsp;Platonick Song of the Soul</i> (1647).</p>

<p>There is little relationship between <i>Democritus Platonissans</i>
and the rest of More’s poetry; even the main work to which it supposedly
forms a final and conclusive canto provides only the slightest excuse
for such a continuation. Certainly, in <i>Psychathanasia</i>, More is
excited by the new astronomy; he praises the Copernican system
throughout Book III, giving an account of it according to the lessons of
his study of Galileo’s <i>Dialogo</i>, which he may have been reading
even as he wrote.<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href =
"#note2">2</a> Indeed, More tries to harmonize the two poems&mdash;his
habit was always to look for unity. But even though <i>Democritus
Platonissans</i> explores an astronomical subject, just as the third
part of <i>Psychathanasia</i> also does, its attitude and theme are
quite different; for More had meanwhile been reading Descartes.</p>

<p>More’s theory of the infinity of worlds and God’s plenitude evidently
owed a great deal to Descartes’ recent example; More responds
exuberantly to him, especially to his <i>Principes de la Philosophie</i>
(1644); for in him he fancied having found a true ally. Steeped in
Platonic and neo-Platonic thought, and determined
<span class = "pagenum">iii</span>
<!-- png 05 -->
to reconcile Spirit with the rational mind of man, More thought he had
discovered in Cartesian ‘intuition’ what was not necessarily there.
Descartes had enjoyed an ecstatic illumination, and so had Plotinus; but
this was not enough, as More may have wanted to imagine, to make
Descartes a neo-Platonist.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3"
href = "#note3">3</a> But the Platonic element implicit in Descartes,
his theory of innate ideas, and his proof of the existence of God from
the idea of God, all helped to make More so receptive to him.
Nevertheless, More did not really need Descartes, nor, as he himself was
later to discover, had he even understood him properly, for More had
looked at him only to find his own reflection.</p>

<p>But there was nothing really new about the idea of infinite worlds
which More described in <i>Democritus Platonissans</i>; it surely was
not a conception unique to Descartes. The theory was a common one in
Greek and Renaissance thought. Democritus and the Epicureans, of course,
advocated the theme of infinite worlds in an infinite universe which
More accepted; but at the same time, he rejected their view of a
mechanistic and fortuitous creation. Although Plato specifically rejects
the idea of infinite worlds (in&nbsp;<i>Timaeus</i>), More imagines, as
the title of his poem implies, a&nbsp;Platonic universe, by which he
really means neo-Platonic, combined with a Democritean plurality of
worlds. More filled space, not with the infinite void of the Atomists,
but with the Divine, ever active immanence. More, in fact, in an early
philosophic work, <i>An Antidote against Atheisme</i> (1652), and again
in <i>Divine Dialogues</i> (1668), refutes Lucretius by asserting the
usefulness of all created things in God’s Providence and the essential
design in Nature. His reference in <i>Democritus Platonissans</i>
(st.&nbsp;20) is typical: “though I detest the sect/ of Epicurus for
their manners vile,/ Yet what is true I may not well reject.” In
bringing together Democritus’ theories and neo-Platonic thought, More
obviously has attempted reconciliation of two exclusive world views, but
with dubious success.</p>

<p>While More stands firmly before a familiar tradition, his belief in
an infinity of worlds evidently has little immediate
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
<!-- png 06 -->
connection with any predecessors. Even Bruno’s work, or Thomas Digges,’
which could have occupied an important place, seems to have had little,
if any, direct influence on More. It was Descartes who stimulated his
thought at the most receptive moment: in 1642 to have denied a theory
which in 1646 he proclaimed with such force evidently argues in favor of
a most powerful attachment. More responded enthusiastically to what he
deemed a congenial metaphysical system; as a champion of Descartes, he
was first to make him known in England and first in England to praise
the infinity of worlds, yet Descartes’ system could give to him little
real solace. More embraces God’s plenitude and infinity of worlds, he
rejoices in the variety and grandeur of the universe, and he worships it
as he might God Himself; but Descartes was fundamentally uninterested in
such enthusiasms and found them even repellant&mdash;as well as
unnecessary&mdash;to his thought. For More the doctrine of infinity was
a proper corollary of Copernican astronomy and neo-Platonism
(as&nbsp;well as Cabbalistic mysticism) and therefore a necessity to his
whole elaborate and eclectic view of the world.</p>

<p>In introducing Cartesian thought into England, More emphasized
particular physical doctrines mainly described in <i>The Principles of
Philosophy</i>; he shows little interest in the <i>Discourse on the
Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason</i> (1637), or in the
<i>Meditations</i> (1641), both of which were also available to him when
he wrote <i>Democritus Platonissans</i>. In the preface to his poem, he
refers to Descartes whom he seems to have read hopefully: surely
“infinitude” is the same as the Cartesian “indefinite.” “<i>For what is
his <em>mundus indefinitè extensus</em>, but <em>extensus infinitè</em>?
Else it sounds onely <em>infinitus quoad nos</em>, but <em>simpliciter
finitus</em></i>,” for there can be no space “<i>unstuffd with
Atoms</i>.” More thinks that Descartes seems “to mince it,” that
difficulty lies in the interpretation of a word, not in an essential
idea. He is referring to Part II, xxi, of <i>The Principles</i>, but he
quotes, with tacit approval, from Part III, i&nbsp;and ii, in the motto
to the poem. More undoubtedly knows the specific discussion of
‘infinity’ in Part I, xxvi-xxviii, where he must first
<span class = "pagenum">v</span>
<!-- png 07 -->
have felt uneasy delight on reading “that it is not needful to enter
into disputes regarding the infinite, but merely to hold all that in
which we can find no limits as indefinite, such as the extension of the
world&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag4" id =
"tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> More asked Descartes to clarify his
language in their correspondence of 1648-49, the last year of Descartes’
life.</p>

<p><i>Democritus Platonissans</i> is More’s earliest statement about
absolute space and time; by introducing these themes into English
philosophy, he contributed significantly to the intellectual history of
the seventeenth century. Newton, indeed, was able to make use of More’s
forging efforts; but of relative time or space and their measurement,
which so much concerned Newton, More had little to say. He was
preoccupied with the development of a theory which would show that
immaterial substance, with space and time as attributes, is as real and
as absolute as the Cartesian geometrical and spatial account of matter
which he felt was true but much in need of amplification.</p>

<p>In his first letter to Descartes, of 11 December 1648, More wrote:
“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;this indefinite extension is either
<i>simpliciter</i> infinite, or only in respect to us. If you understand
extension to be infinite <i>simpliciter</i>, why do you obscure your
thought by too low and too modest words? If it is infinite only in
respect to us, extension, in reality, will be finite; for our mind is
the measure neither of the things nor of truth.&nbsp;. .&nbsp;.”
Unsatisfied by his first answer from Descartes (5&nbsp;February 1649),
he urges his point again (5&nbsp;March): if extension can describe
matter, the same quality must apply to the immaterial and yet be only
one of many attributes of Spirit. In his second letter to More
(15&nbsp;April), Descartes answers firmly: “It is repugnant to my
concept to attribute any limit to the world, and I have no other measure
than my perception for what I have to assert or to deny. I&nbsp;say,
therefore, that the world is indeterminate or indefinite, because I do
not recognize in it any limits. But I dare not call it infinite as I
perceive that God is greater than the world, not in respect to His
extension, because, as I have already said, I&nbsp;do not acknowledge in
God any proper [extension], but in
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
<!-- png 08 -->
respect to His perfection&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is repugnant to
my mind .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it implies a contradiction, that the world be
finite or limited, because I cannot but conceive a space outside the
boundaries of the world wherever I presuppose them.” More plainly fails
to understand the basic dualism inherent in Cartesian philosophy and to
sense the irrelevance of his questions. While Descartes is really
disposing of the spiritual world in order to get on with his analysis of
finite experience, More is keenly attempting to reconcile neo-Platonism
with the lively claims of matter. His effort can be read as the brave
attempt to harmonize an older mode of thought with the urgency of the
‘new philosophy’ which called the rest in doubt. More saw this conflict
and the implications of it with a kind of clarity that other men of his
age hardly possessed. But the way of Descartes, which at first seemed to
him so promising, certainly did not lead to the kind of harmony which he
sought.</p>

<p>More’s original enthusiasm for Descartes declined as he understood
better that the Cartesian world in practice excluded spirits and souls.
Because Descartes could find no necessary place even for God Himself,
More styled him, in <i>Enchiridion Metaphysicum</i> (1671), the “Prince
of the Nullibists”; these men “readily acknowledge there are such things
as <i>Incorporeal Beings</i> or <i>Spirits</i>, yet do very peremptorily
contend, that they are <i>no where</i> in the whole World [;]
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because they so boldly affirm that a Spirit is
<i>Nullibi</i>, that is to say, <i>no where</i>,” they deserve to be
called <i>Nullibists</i>.<a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id = "tag5" href
= "#note5">5</a> In contrast to these false teachers, More describes
absolute space by listing twenty epithets which can be applied either to
God or to pure extension, such as “Unum, Simplex, Immobile
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Incomprehensible <ins class = "correction" title =
"space in original (not explained in footnote)">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</ins>”<a class = "tag" name = "tag6"
id = "tag6" href = "#note6">6</a> There is, however, a&nbsp;great
difficulty here; for while Space and Spirit are eternal and uncreated,
they yet contain material substance which has been created by God. If
the material world possesses infinite extension, as More generally
believes, that would preclude any need of its having a creator. In order
to avoid this dilemma, which <i>Democritus Platonissans</i> ignores,
More must at last separate matter and space, seeing the
<span class = "pagenum">vii</span>
<!-- png 09 -->
latter as an attribute of God through which He is able to contain a
finite world limited in space as well as in time. In writing that “this
infinite space because of its infinity is distinct from matter,”<a class
= "tag" name = "tag7" id = "tag7" href = "#note7">7</a> More reveals the
direction of his conclusion; the dichotomy it embodies is Cartesianism
in reverse.</p>

<p>While More always labored to describe the ineffable, his earliest
work, the poetry, may have succeeded in this wish most of all. Although
he felt that his poetry was aiming toward truths which his “<i>later and
better concocted Prose</i>”<a class = "tag" name = "tag8" id = "tag8"
href = "#note8">8</a> reached, the effort cost him the suggestiveness of
figurative speech. In urging himself on toward an ever more consistent
statement of belief, he lost much of his beginning exuberance (best
expressed in the brief “Philosopher’s Devotion”) and the joy of
intellectual discovery. In the search “<i>to find out Words which will
prove faithful witnesses of the peculiarities of my Thoughts</i>,” he
staggers under the unsupportable burden of too many words. In trying so
desperately to clarify his thought, he rejected poetic discourse as
“slight”; only a language free of metaphor and symbol could, he
supposed, lead toward correctness. Indeed, More soon renounced poetry;
he apparently wrote no more after collecting it in <i>Philosophical
Poems</i> (1647), when he gave up poetry for “more seeming Substantial
performances in solid <i>Prose</i>.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag9" id =
"tag9" href = "#note9">9</a> “Cupids Conflict,” which is “annexed” to
<i>Democritus Platonissans</i>, is an interesting revelation of the
failure of poetry, as More felt it: he justifies his “rude rugged
uncouth style” by suggesting that sweet verses avoid telling important
truths; harshness and obscurity may at least remind one that there is a
significance beyond mere words. His lament is characteristic: “How ill
alas! with wisdome it accords/ To sell my living sense for liveless
words.”</p>

<p>In spite of these downcast complaints, More was quite capable of
lively and meaningful poetic ideas. One is the striking image of the
cone which occurs in <i>Democritus Platonissans</i> (especially in
stanzas 7-8, 66-67, and&nbsp;88) and becomes the most essential symbol
to More’s expression of infinitude and extension. The figure first
appears in <i>Antipsychopannychia</i>
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
<!-- png 10 -->
(II.9) where his purpose is to reconcile the world Soul with Christian
eschatology. In <i>Democritus Platonissans</i>, the cone enables More to
adapt the familiar Hermetic paradox:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "indent">A Circle whose circumference no where</p>
<p class = "indent">Is circumscrib’d, whose Centre’s each where set,</p>
<p class = "indent">But the low Cusp’s a figure circular,</p>
<p>Whose compasse is ybound, but centre’s every where. (st.&nbsp;8)</p>
</div>

<p>Every point on the circumference, or base of the cone, relates to the
single point at the top. The world, More wants to say, has no limits, no
center, yet there are bounds in its not having any. More recognizes the
contradiction when he fancies “some strong arm’d Archer” at the wide
world’s edge (st.&nbsp;37). Where shall he send his shafts? Into “mere
vacuity”? But More hardly seems aware of the inappropriateness of the
cone: he uses a geometrical figure to locate space, time, and numberless
worlds within the universal sight of God, but matter is infinite,
“distinct/ And yet proceeding from the Deitie” (st.&nbsp;68). Obviously,
the archer must forever be sending his arrows through an infinitely
expanding surface. Nevertheless, the cone has great value as a metaphor,
as a richly suggestive and fascinating conception. More, however, does
not want to speak metaphorically; he is attempting to disclose truths,
literal and plain, where pretty words and metaphors have no place. Even
as he is writing his most effective poetry, we are aware that More is
denying his poetic office; for he is pleading a reasoned case where the
words crack and strain, where poetic meaning gathers, only to be
denied.</p>

<p>But these objections momentarily disappear when More forgets himself
enough to let us feel his imagination and does not worry that we might
miss the proofs of his philosophy. <i>Democritus Platonissans</i>
concludes with an apocalyptic vision wherein the poet imagines the
reconciliation of infinite worlds and time within God’s immensity. He is
also attempting to harmonize
<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
<!-- png 11 -->
<i>Psychathanasia</i>, where he rejected infinitude, with its <ins class
= "correction" title = "l invisible at line-end">sequel</ins>
<i>Democritus Platonissans</i>, where he has everywhere been declaring
it; thus we should think of endless worlds as we should think of Nature
and the Phoenix, dying yet ever regenerative, sustained by a “centrall
power/ Of hid spermatick life” which sucks “sweet heavenly juice” from
above (st.&nbsp;101). More closes his poem on a vision of harmony and
ceaseless energy, a&nbsp;most fit ending for one who dared to believe
that the new philosophy sustained the old, that all coherence had not
gone out of the world, but was always there, only waiting to be
discovered afresh in this latter age.</p>

<p><a name = "note1" id = "note1" href = "#tag1">1.</a>
The quotations from More’s Latin autobiography occur in the <i>Opera
Omnia</i> (London, 1675-79), portions of which Richard Ward translated
in <i>The Life of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Henry More</i> (London, 1710). Cf. the
modern edition of this work, ed. M.&nbsp;F. Howard (London, 1911), pp.
61, 67-68, the text followed here. There is a recent reprint of the
<i>Opera Omnia</i> in 3 volumes (Hildesheim, 1966) with an introduction
by Serge Hutin. The “Praefatio Generalissima” begins vol. II.&nbsp;1.
One passage in it which Ward did not translate describes the <ins class
= "correction" title = "final s illegible at line-end">genesis</ins> of
<i>Democritus Platonissans</i>. More writes that after finishing
<i>Psychathanasia</i>, he felt a change of heart: “Postea vero mutata
sententia furore nescio quo Poetico incitatus supra dictum Poema
scripsi, ea potissimum innixus ratione quod liquido constaret
extensionem spacii dari infinitam, nec majores absurditates pluresve
contingere posse in Materia infinita, infinitaque; Mundi duratione, quam
in infinita Extensione spacii” (p.&nbsp;ix).</p>

A&nbsp;thing monstrous if assented to, and to be startled at, especially
by them, whose thoughts this one have alwayes so engaged, that they can
find no leisure to think of any thing else. But I onely make a bare
proposall to more acute judgements, of what my sportfull fancie, with
pleasure hath suggested: following my old designe of furnishing mens
minds with varietie of apprehensions concerning the most weightie points
of Philosophie, that they may not seem rashly to have settled in the
truth, though it be the truth: a&nbsp;thing as ill beseeming
Philosophers, as hastie prejudicative sentence Politicall Judges. But if
I had relinquishd here my wonted self, in proving Dogmaticall,
I&nbsp;should have found very noble Patronage for the cause among the
ancients, <em>Epicurus</em>, <em>Democritus</em>, <em>Lucretius</em>,
<em>&amp;c.</em> Or if justice may reach the dead, do them the right, as
to shew, that though they be hooted at, by the Rout of the learned, as
men of monstrous conceits, they were either very wise or exceeding
fortunate to light on so probable and specious an opinion, in which
notwithstanding there is so much difficultie and seeming
inconsistencie.</p>

<p>Nay and that sublime and subtil Mechanick too, <em>DesChartes</em>,
though he seem to mince it must hold infinitude of worlds, or which is
as harsh one infinite <ins class = "correction" title = ". missing (other text unchanged)">one.</ins> For what is his <em>mundus indefinitè
extensus</em>, but <em>extensus infinitè</em>? Else it sounds onely
<em>infinitus quoad nos</em> but <em>simpliciter finitus</em>. But if
any space be left out unstuffd with Atoms, it will hazard the
dissipation of the whole frame of Nature into disjoynted dust. As may be
proved by the Principles of his own Philosophie.
<span class = "pagenum">[ii]</span>

And that there is space whereever God is, or any actuall and
self-subsistent Being, seems to me no plainer then one of the <span
class = "greek" title = "koinai ennoiai">κοιναί ἔννοιαι</span>.</p>

<p>For mine own part I must confesse these apprehensions do plainly
oppose what heretofore I have conceived; but I have sworn more faithfull
friendship with Truth then with myself. And therefore without all
remorse lay batterie against mine own edifice: not sparing to shew how
weak that is, that my self now deems not impregnably strong. I&nbsp;have
at the latter end of the last Canto of <em>Psychathanasia</em>, not
without triumph concluded, that the world hath not continued <em>ab
æterno</em>, from this ground:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "halfway">Extension</p>
<p>That’s infinite implies a contradiction.</p>
</div>

<p>And this is in answer to an objection against my last argument of the
souls Immortalitie, <em>viz.</em> divine goodnesse, which I there make
the measure of his providence. That ground limits the essence of the
world as well as its duration, and satisfies the curiositie of the
Opposer, by shewing the incompossibilitie in the Creature, not want of
goodnesse in the Creatour to have staid the framing of the Universe. But
now roused up by a new Philosophick furie, I&nbsp;answer that
difficultie by taking away the Hypothesis of either the world or time
being finite: defending the infinitude of <ins class = "correction"
title = "text has . for ,">both,</ins> which though I had done with a
great deal of vigour and life, and semblance of assent, it would have
agreed well enough with the free beat of Poesie, and might have passed
for a pleasant flourish: but the severitie of my own judgement, and sad
Genius hath cast in many correctives and coolers into the Canto it self;
so that it cannot amount to more then a discussion. And discussion is no
prejudice but an honour to the truth: for then and never but then is she
Victorious. And what a glorious Trophee shall the finite world erect
when it hath vanquished the Infinite; a&nbsp;Pygmee a Giant.</p>

<p>For the better understanding of the connexion of this Appendix, with
the Poem of the souls Immortalitie; I&nbsp;have taken off the last
stanza’s thereof, and added some few new ones to them for a more easie
and naturall leading to the present Canto. <em>Psychathan. lib. 3. Cant.

<p><i><span class = "dropcap">B</span>
<span class = "second">o</span>dy.</i> The ancient Philosophers have
defined it, <span class = "greek" title = "To trichêi diastaton met’ antitupias">Τὸ τριχῇ διάστατον μετ’ ἀντιτυπίας</span>. <i>Sext. Emperic.
Pyrrhon. Hypotyp. lib. 3. cap. 5.</i> Near to this is that description,
<i>Psychathan</i>, Cant. 2. Stanz. 12. lib. 2, <i>Matter extent in three
dimensions.</i> But for that <span class = "greek" title =
"antitupia">ἀντιτυπία</span>, simple trinall distension doth not imply
it, wherefore I declin’d it. But took in <i>matter</i> according to
their conceit, that phansie <i>à Materia prima</i>, I acknowledge none,
and consequently no such <i>corpus naturale</i> as our Physiologist make
the subject of that science. That <span class = "greek" title = "Trichêi diastaton antitupon">Τριχῇ διάστατον ἀντίτυπον</span> is nothing but a
fixt spirit, the conspissation or coagulation of the Cuspidall particles
of the Cone, which are indeed the Centrall Tasis or inward essence of
the sensible world. These be an infinite number of vitall Atoms that may
be wakened into diverse tinctures, or energies, into fiery, watery,
earthy, &amp;c. And one divine <i>Fiat</i> can unloose them all into an
universall mist, or turn them out of that sweat into a drie and pure
Etheriall temper. These be the last projections of life from the soul of
the world; and are act or form though debil and indifferent, like that
which they call the first matter. But they are not meerly passive
<span class = "pagenum">[2]</span>
<span class = "folionum">||</span>
<!-- png 66 -->
but meet their information half way, as I may so speak: are radiant
<i>ab intimo</i> and awake into this or the other operation, by the
powerfull appulse of some superadvenient form. That which change of
Phantasmes is to the soul, that is alteration of rayes to them. For
their rayes are <i>ab intrinseco</i>, as the phantasmes of the soul.
These be the reall matter of which all supposed bodies are compounded,
and this matter (as&nbsp;I said) is form and life, so that all is life
and form what ever is in the world, as I have somewhere intimated in
<i>Antipsychopan</i>: But however I use the terme <i>body</i> ordinarily
in the usuall and vulgar acception. And for that sense of the ancients,
nearest to which I have defined it in the place first above mentioned,
that I seem not to choose that same as most easie to proceed against in
disproving the corporeity of the soul, the arguments do as necessarily
conclude against such a naturall body as is ordinarily described in
Physiologie (as&nbsp;you may plainly discern if you list to observe) as
also against this body composed of the Cuspidall particles of the Cone.
For though they be Centrall lives, yet are they neither Plasticall,
Sensitive, or Rationall, so farre are they from proving to be the humane
soul whose nature is there discust.</p>

turning of a rectangular triangle, about; one of the sides that include
the right angle resting, which will be then the Axis of the compleated
Cone. But I take it sometimes for the comprehension of all things, God
himself not left out, whom I tearm the <i>Basis</i> of the <i>Cone</i>
or <i>Universe</i>. And because all from him descends, <span class =
"greek" title = "kath’ hupostolên">καθ’ ὑποστολῆν</span>, with abatement
or contraction, I&nbsp;give the name of <i>Cone</i> to the Universe. And
of Cone rather then Pyramid because of the roundnesse of the figure,
which the effluxes of all things imitate.</p>

<p><i>Circulation</i>, The terme is taken from a toyish observation,
<i>viz.</i> the circling of water when a stone is cast into a standing
pool. The motion drives on circularly, the first rings are thickest, but
the further they go they grow the thinner, till they vanish into
nothing. Such is the diffusion of
<span class = "pagenum">[3]</span>
<span class = "folionum">[D7]</span>
<!-- png 67 -->
the species audible in the strucken aire, as also of the visible
species. In brief any thing is said to circulate that diffuseth its
image or species in a round. It might have been more significantly
called orbiculation; seeing this circumfusion makes not onely a circle,
but fills a sphere, which may be called the sphere of activity. Yet
Circulation more fitly sets out the diminution of activity, from those
ringes in the water which as they grow in compasse, abate in force and
thicknesse. But sometimes I use Circulate in an ordinary sense to turn
round, or return in a circle.</p>

<p><i>Centre</i>, <i>Centrall</i>, <i>Centrality</i>. When they are used
out of their ordinary sense, they signifie the depth or inmost being of
any thing, from whence its acts and energies flow forth. See
<i>Atom-lives</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cuspis</i> of the <i>Cone</i>. The multiplide Cuspis of the Cone
is nothing but the last projection of life from Psyche, which is <span
class = "greek" dir = "rtl" title = "[Hebrew] shamayim">שׁמים</span>
a&nbsp;liquid fire or fire and water, which are the corporeall or
materiall principles of all things, changed or disgregated (if&nbsp;they
be centrally distinguishable) and again mingled by the virtue of Physis
or Spermaticall life of the world; of these are the Sunne and all the
Planets, they being kned together, and fixt by the Centrall power of
each Planet and Sunne. The volatile Ether is also of the same, and all
the bodies of plants, beasts and men. These are they which we handle and
touch, a&nbsp;sufficient number compact together. For neither is the

<p>Comparing of all these places together, I cannot better explain this
Platonick term, <i>energie</i>, then by calling it the rayes of an
essence, or the beams of a vitall Centre. For essence is the Centre as
it were of that which is truly called Energie, and Energie the beams and
rayes of an essence. And as the <i>Radii</i> of a circle leave not the
centre by touching the Circumference, no more doth that which is the
pure Energie of an essence, leave the essence by being called out into
act, but is <span class = "greek" title = "en-ergeia">ἐν-έργεια</span>
a&nbsp;working in the essence though it flow <i>out</i> into act. So
that <i>Energie</i> depends alwayes on essence, as <i>Lumen</i> on
<i>Lux</i>, or the creature on God; Whom therefore Synesius in his
Hymnes calls the Centre of all things.</p>

and not filling all as the other do. But if you take it for the whole
sensible world, it is entire, and is the same that <i>Tasis</i> in
Psycozoia. But the centre of <i>Tasis</i>, viz. the multiplication of
the reall <i>Cuspis</i> of the <i>Cone</i> (for <i>Hyle</i> that is set
for the most contract point of the <i>Cuspis</i> is scarce to be
reckoned among realities) that immense diffusion of atoms, is to be
referred to <i>Psyche</i>, as an internall vegetative act, and so
belongs to <i>Physis</i> the lowest order of life. For as that warmth
that the sense doth afford the body, is not rationall, sensitive, or
imaginative, but vegetative; So this, <span class = "greek" dir = "rtl"

ubiquitie, <i>viz.</i> in its own sphear. And this is either by being in
that sphear omnipresent it self, as the soul is said to be in the body
<i>tota in toto &amp; tota in qualibet parte</i>, or else at least by
propagation of rayes, which is the image of it self; and so are divers
sensible objects <i>Reduplicative</i>, as light, colours, sounds. And I
make account either of these wayes justly denominate any thing
spirituall. Though the former is most properly, at least more eminently
spirituall. And whether any thing be after that way spirituall saving
the Divinitie, there is reason to doubt. For what is entirely
omnipresent in a sphear, whose diametre is but three feet, I&nbsp;see
not, why (that in the circumference being as fresh and entire as that in

<h5><a name = "endnote" id = "endnote">Spelling and Language</a></h5>

<p>The author used a number of forms that were unusual or archaic even
in
1646, and might be mistaken for typographical errors:</p>

<div class = "hanging">
<p><b>ne</b> (conjunction)</p>
<p><b>won</b><br>
<i>stay, dwell</i> (like German <i>wohnen</i>)</p>
<p><b>eath</b><br>
<i>easy, light</i>; also <b>uneath</b></p>
</div>

<p>Words in <b>-en</b>, especially verbs:</p>

<p class = "inset">
<b>aboven</b>, <b>amazen</b>, <b>been</b> (<i>infinitive</i>),
<b>causen</b>, <b>standen</b>, <b>withouten</b>...</p>

<p>Both occurrences of the name “DesCartes” or “DesChartes” are at line
break; the hyphen has been omitted conjecturally. In general, spellings
that appear more than once, such as “Psyc-” for “Psych-”, were assumed
to be inten&shy;tional. In corrections, the word “invisible” means that
the letter is absent but there is an appropriately sized blank
space.</p>

<p>Greek diacritics were consistently printed over the first vowel of an
initial diphthong. This has been silently regularized.</p>

<h5>Pagination</h5>

<p><i>Democritus Platonissans</i> and <i>Cupids Conflict</i> were each
paginated from 1; other parts of the original have no visible page
numbers. Individual missing numbers may have been too near the margin to
be included in the facsimile. Folio numbers (signatures) are continuous
for the whole text. Gaps in the sequence represent blank pages, except
that A was probably a half-octavo (4&nbsp;leaves instead of&nbsp;8).</p>
